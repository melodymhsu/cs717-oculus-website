		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>
			Virtual Reality (VR) is a rapidly evolving area of technology that is becoming increasingly prevalent in 
			a wide area of applications such as art, education, business, entertainment, and much more. 

			With such diversity in its applications, what our team aims to address is how we can use VR to develop
			the future of virtual real-time collaboration and communication. Our goal is to ensure that within the 
			continental United States, users joining a common virtual space are experiencing events and interacting 
			at the same time. Additionally, all users should see a consistent view of the world as it changes in response 
			to user input and interaction.
			
			Perhaps the most notable of the currently released VR devices (as of May 2022) is Meta's Oculus Quest 2, 
			which is what our team uses in our project development. Using the Oculus Quest, Unity Engine for game 
			development, and <a href="http://www.spines.org/">Spines</a> infrastructure to impose artificial latencies
			in server-to-server communication, we created an application that is extensible to general VR devices and enables
			players to interact in real-time (<em>&lt; 65 ms</em> delay).
		</p>
		<br />

		<h2>System Architecture and Protocol</h2>
		<p>
				Each VR device has a local state about where the headset and controllers are positioned. Oftentimes, games 
				update the local state, then update the server, then reconcile the local and server states. However, this
				can lead to inconsistent representations of what users see, as it would always be the case that one's device
				will first update its own state before reconciling its information with other devices. 

				Our application instead updates the server first, then updates the local state based on the server state. 
				This allows the server to consolidate information about all players and the world state before individual 
				player views are rendered locally.

			</div>

			Synchonous delivery is achieved by having the receiving servers store messages from clients and order them by 
			timestamp in a priority queue. Following a 65 ms delay, server responses are sent back to the clients.
			Messages sent between client and servers are formatted using a 
			<a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers">protocol buffer</a>. 
		</ul>

			<div class="media">
				<img style="margin: 20px;" src="./interactive_vr_assets/images/ADS-server-aggregatort-transparent.png" width="900">
			</div>

			Messages are sent between servers on the Spines overlay network, which connects all servers. In this manner, servers
			collectively share information about an agreed world state that all players see.

		<h2>Spines</h2>
		<p>
			On each of the 8 servers we had running in the <a href="https://www.cnds.jhu.edu/">Distributed Systems and Networks</a> 
			lab, a Spines daemon was run to represent one of the below locations. Each link between two locations represents
			the one-way trip time in miliseconds. By having a server represent each location and using Spines to create artificial 
			links between servers, we emulated the transcontinental path that packets take when routed to and from different 
			destinations across the United States.

			<div class="media">
				<img style="margin: 20px;" src="./interactive_vr_assets/images/continental_spines_overlay.PNG" width="600">
			</div>

			Each player is able to connect to a server at one of the 8 location. As players interact with other players connected
			to servers for varying locations, their communication simulates the realistic experience of players interacting across
			actual geographical distances.

		<h2>Proof of Concept</h2>
		<p>
			Our application allows up to 8 unique players to join a lobby, select a location, and interact with one another.
			Movements made by a player are consistently represented among all player views at the same time, and an added
			layer of interactivity is incorporated in the game objects placed in the environment. Below is the initial 
			user interface that players will see and interact with to connect to a server and join a lobby.
		</p>
		
		<div class="media">
			<img style="margin: 20px;" src="./interactive_vr_assets/images/ui.jpg" width="600">
		</div>

		Players are able to claim posession over objects and move a sphere with their controllers. To provide a tactile 
		demonstration of the synchronized delay between user input and server responses, haptic feedback is also built into 
		this interactive component. Players can click a button to send a haptic message to all other players in the lobby, 
		in which all players (including the player who sent the message) will feel a controller rumble 65 ms after the 
		haptic message is sent.

		<div class="media">
			<img style="margin: 20px;" src="./interactive_vr_assets/images/overview.jpg" width="600">
		</div>

		Real-time metrics such as client-server ping time, packet round trip times, and message processing times can be 
		evaluated while players are in the lobby. Players can additionally see which other players have joined the world.

		<h2>Interactables</h2>
		The below clip demonstrates how players can interact with objects and claim possession over them. Notice that
		at most one player can claim possession over an object at any given time. This state of object possession is 
		consitent among all players in the world.

		<h2>Metrics</h2>
		<p>
			All metrics were collected in a setting where the average round trip ping time was ~2 ms. Note that
			this additional ping time factors into the overall latency seen in subsequent graphs.

			<div class="media">
				<img style="margin: 20px;" src="./interactive_vr_assets/images/player_pings.png" width="600">
			</div>

			Below are the examples of the time differences between when a player located in Washington, D.C. receives
			and handles messages from players connected to other servers. The receive graph demonstrates that the 
			latencies between destinations accurately reflect the expected overlay network that was reconstructed 
			using spines.
	
			<div class="media">
				<img style="margin: 20px;" src="./interactive_vr_assets/images/WAS_receive.png" width="600">
			</div>

			Since all servers deliver messages after a 65 ms delay, it is ensured that every player will receive 
			updates to their world state in synchrony. This delay is confirmed by the following graph, which includes 
			the additional client-server ping time.
