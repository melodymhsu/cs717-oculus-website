	<h2>Overview</h2>
	<p>
		Virtual Reality (VR) is a rapidly evolving area of technology that is becoming increasingly prevalent in 
		a wide area of applications such as art, education, business, entertainment, and much more. 

		With such diversity in its applications, what our team aims to address is how we can use VR to develop
		the future of virtual real-time collaboration and communication. Our goal is to ensure that within the 
		continental United States, users joining a common virtual space are experiencing events and interacting 
		at the same time. Additionally, all users should see a consistent view of the world as it changes in response 
		to user input and interaction.
		
		Perhaps the most notable of the currently released VR devices (as of May 2022) is Meta's Oculus Quest 2, 
		which is what our team uses in our project development. Using the Oculus Quest, Unity Engine for game 
		development, and <a href="http://www.spines.org/">Spines</a> infrastructure to impose artificial latencies
		in server communication, we created an application that is extensible to general VR devices and enables
		players to interact in real-time (&lt; 65 ms delay).

	<h2>Spines</h2>

		<br>
		On each of the 8 servers we had running in the <a href="https://www.cnds.jhu.edu/">Distributed Systems and Networks</a> 
		lab, a Spines daemon was run to represent one of the above locations. Each link between two locations represents
		the one-way trip time in miliseconds. By having a server represent each location and using Spines to create artificial 
		links between servers, we emulated the transcontinental path that packets take when routed to and from different 
		destinations across the United States.
